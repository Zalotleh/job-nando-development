          <h2>6. Payment of Fees and Taxes</h2>
              You will pay the Fees applicable to your subscription to the 365 Talent Hub online services "Subscription Fees" and any other applicable fees,
              including but not limited to fees related to the value of sales made through your platform when using payment providers other than Stripe "Transaction Fees",
              and any fees related to the purchase or use of additional products or services "Additional Fees". 
              Together, the Subscription Fees, Transaction Fees, and Additional Fees are referred to as the "Fees".
              You must keep a valid payment method on file with us to pay for all incurred and recurring Fees.
              We will charge the applicable Fees to any valid payment method that you authorize "Authorized Payment Method",
              and we will continue to charge the Authorized Payment Method for applicable Fees until the services are terminated,
              and any outstanding Fees have been paid in full. Unless otherwise indicated, all Fees and other charges are in Euro.
              and all payments will be in Euro currency.

              Subscription Fees are paid in advance and will be billed in 30-day intervals each such date, a "Billing Date".
              Transaction Fees and Additional Fees will be charged from time to time at our discretion.
              You will be charged on each Billing Date for all outstanding Fees that have not previously been charged.
              Fees will appear on an invoice, which will be sent to the account owner via the primary email address provided.
              Additionally, an invoice will appear on the account page of your subscription details console.
              Users have approximately two weeks to address and resolve any issues with the billing of Subscription Fees.

              If we are unable to process payment of Fees using an Authorized Payment Method,
              we may make subsequent attempts to process payment using any Authorized Payment Method.
              If we are unable to successfully process payment of Fees using an Authorized Payment Method within 7 days of our initial attempt,
              we may suspend and revoke access to your account and the services. Your access will be reactivated upon your payment of any outstanding Fees,
              plus the Fees applicable to your next billing cycle. You may not be able to access your account or your platform during any period of suspension.
              If the outstanding Fees remain unpaid for 14 days following the date of suspension,
              we reserve the right to terminate your account.

              All Fees are exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state, local,
              or other governmental sales, goods and services taxes including any relevant taxes under the local tax regulations.
              You are responsible for all applicable taxes that arise from or as a result of your subscription to or purchase of our products and services.
              To the extent that we charge these taxes, they are calculated based on the tax rates that apply according to the provided billing address.
              Such amounts are in addition to the Fees for the products and services and will be billed to your Authorized Payment Method.
              If you are exempt from paying such taxes, you must provide us with evidence of your exemption,
              which may include a certificate satisfying the applicable legal requirements for tax-exempt status.
              Tax exemption will only apply from and after the date we receive satisfactory evidence of your exemption.
              If you are not charged taxes by us, you are responsible for determining if taxes are payable and, if so,
              self-remitting taxes to the appropriate tax authorities in your jurisdiction.

              For the avoidance of doubt, all sums payable by you to 365 Talent Hub under these Terms will be paid free and clear of any deductions or withholdings whatsoever.
              Other than taxes charged by 365 Talent Hub to you and remitted to the appropriate tax authorities on your behalf,
              any deductions or withholdings required by law will be borne by you and paid separately to the relevant taxation authority.
              We will be entitled to charge the full amount of Fees stipulated under these Terms to your Authorized Payment Method, 
              ignoring any such deduction or withholding that may be required.

              You are solely responsible for determining, collecting, withholding, reporting, and remitting applicable taxes, duties, fees, surcharges,
              and additional charges that arise from or as a result of any sale on your 365 Talent Hub platform or your use of the services.
              The services provided are not a marketplace. Any contract of sale made through the services is directly between you and the customer.

              You must maintain an accurate location in the console of your 365 Talent Hub platform. If you change jurisdictions,
              you must promptly update your location in the console.
